#  Big Data Project by Himanshu Rai

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Big Data Analytics** using the **Hadoop ecosystem** — including **MySQL**, **Sqoop**, **Hive**, and **HDFS** — to analyze large retail datasets efficiently.  
The aim is to perform data integration, analysis, and visualization for better business insights in a cloud-based environment (Cloudera).

##  Technologies Used
- **MySQL** – For structured data storage and SQL queries  
- **Sqoop** – For importing/exporting data between MySQL and Hadoop  
- **Hive** – For big data querying using HiveQL  
- **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)** – For distributed data storage  
- **Cloudera** – As the cloud environment for Hadoop ecosystem

##  Dataset
**Name:** `INDIA_RETAIL_DATA_SIMPLIFIED.csv`  
**Description:**  
A simplified retail dataset containing product, sales, and order details used to analyze:
- Customer purchase behavior  
- Product performance  
- Sales and profit trends
